* Removed all references to react-toastify and associated code
* Removed the package bootstrap and just include bootstrap.css now from /public/static folder


## Module 2

* Small changes and fixes

## Module 3

* Clips 3 and 4 completely re-written.  All the code for the demo app is now developed.  Removed overview and replaced with coding details.

## Module 4

No changes

## Module 5

Clips 7 through 13 are all new. They start out with implementing the REST server using NextJS API routes. Then, after
all the coding and examples are upgrade to REST, the code is upgrade to handle server-side rendering.  Following that, the code is
updated to Incremental Static Regeneration, which means static pages are generated by the node server in the background when there are
REST backend changes, but all pages are rendered to user are 100% static.


## Module 6

Clip 8 was added to solve a bug where the saturday/sunday checkboxes did not cause the images to recalculate whether they are in view or not (causing colorization to be wrong until a scroll event happens).
