# August 2020 Update Notes "Using React Hooks"

## Completely NEW Module 6 - useContext + useReducer -> Redux Like App State

[Direct Link to Module 6](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=using-react-hooks&author=peter-kellner&name=95df19ab-9a51-4c3c-bb40-38358c179ee1&clip=0&mode=live)

One of the most powerful features that become available to you after learning 
how to use React Hooks, specifically the useContext and useReducer hooks, is that you
can combine the two to make a powerful "redux-like" solution for gobally sharing 
data between different parts of your application hierarchy.

I've literally added 30 minutes of 100% new content to the course that covers how to do this. 
I'd suggest you re-watch [Module 5](https://app.pluralsight.com/player?course=using-react-hooks&author=peter-kellner&name=5b710e27-32b2-4f8d-930b-b8ccd29a3ecc&clip=0&mode=live), building custom hooks first if you've not, then module 6,
